# Weather MCP Server Progress

## What Works
- Project repository has been initialized
- Required dependencies have been added to package.json:
  - MCP SDK (version 1.7.0)
  - TypeScript support
  - Zod for validation
  - Axios for API requests
- Project configuration is complete:
  - package.json configured with proper scripts
  - tsconfig.json created with appropriate settings
- MCP server implementation is complete:
  - Server class structure with proper error handling
  - Weather API integration with NWS service
  - Tool implementation for get_forecast and get_alerts
  - Resource template for state alerts
  - Formatted data output
- Server has been built and is executable

## What's In Progress
- Testing with MCP clients
- Documentation creation

## What's Left to Build
- âœ… Core server implementation
- âœ… HTTP service for NWS API interaction
- âœ… Data transformation utilities
- âœ… get_forecast tool implementation
- âœ… get_alerts tool implementation
- âœ… Resource handler implementation
- âœ… Error handling and logging
- â¬œ Integration testing with Claude Desktop
- â¬œ User documentation
- âœ… Build and distribution setup

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR TESTING**

The core implementation is complete. The server has been built and is ready for testing with MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

## Known Issues
- Limited to US weather data via the NWS API
- No caching implemented yet (could improve performance)
- Not yet tested with actual MCP clients

## Blocking Items
- None at this time

## Next Milestones
1. **Integration Testing** - Verify functionality with Claude Desktop
2. **User Documentation** - Complete setup and usage instructions
3. **Feature Enhancements** - Add more data points and caching

## Development Notes
- Will need to implement proper User-Agent headers for NWS API
- May need to add CLI arguments parsing for future enhancements
- Should test the build process across different platforms
