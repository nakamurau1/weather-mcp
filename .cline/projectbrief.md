# Weather MCP Server Project Brief

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for weather data using TypeScript. The server will provide tools to fetch weather forecasts and alerts, making this information accessible to LLMs like Claude through the MCP protocol.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement an MCP server using the TypeScript SDK
2. Create tools to fetch weather data from the National Weather Service API
3. Provide formatted, user-friendly weather information
4. Follow MCP protocol standards for seamless integration with clients

## Goals
- Create a robust weather data provider for LLMs
- Enable natural language interactions with weather data
- Demonstrate effective implementation of the MCP protocol
- Provide a template for future MCP server implementations

## Scope
- Weather forecast data retrieval by geographic coordinates
- Weather alerts retrieval by US state
- Clean error handling and user-friendly responses
- Documentation and setup instructions

## Out of Scope
- Historical weather data
- Weather prediction analysis
- International weather sources (initially using US National Weather Service)
- UI components or visual displays

## Success Criteria
- Successful integration with Claude or other MCP clients
- Accurate weather data retrieval and formatting
- Responsive and reliable API interactions
- Clear documentation for setup and usage
